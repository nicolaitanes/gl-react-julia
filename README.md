# gl-react-julia

[Universal](https://projectseptemberinc.gitbooks.io/gl-react/content/docs/universal.html) gl-react Julia set fractals.

[Julia sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) are generated by iterating `z = z^p + c` for each point `z` in the complex plane.

This package includes a standard Julia set (`<JuliaFractal>`)), along with two extensions of the concept:

- `<JuliaImageFractal>`: picks up paint from a source image at each successive `z` and combines it as the color of pixel `z0`
- `<JuliaFieldFractal>`: like JuliaImageFractal, but `p` is recomputed each iteration as a function of the underlying image color and any other numbers that are handy (e.g. `z`, `c`, `z0`, etc.)

## Props

- center (required): [x, y]
- zoom (required): 0 is full size, 1 is double magnification, 2 is 4x, ...
- c (required): Julia constant -- [real, imaginary]
- p (required): Julia power (`number`) (or input to `JuliaFieldFractal`'s `fieldExpr`)
- image: source url for `JuliaImageFractal` and `JuliaFieldFractal`
- fieldExpr: e.g. `dot(hsv.xz, z)` -- Julia power `p` varies with the angle between (hue, brightness) and (real, imaginary) vectors.  The output is interpreted as a proportion of `r` vs `q`: `p = q + (r-q)*$fieldExpr`.
- q (`JuliaFieldFractal` only) -- input to `fieldExpr`
- r (`JuliaFieldFractal` only) -- input to `fieldExpr`
